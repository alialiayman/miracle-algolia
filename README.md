# Miracle Algolia Project Readme

This readme provides an overview of the Algolia project, how to set it up, and some additional information.

## Description

This project is built using Algolia, a powerful search and discovery platform. The project allows users to search and filter data based on different parameters. The search results are displayed in real-time as the user types in their search query. Additionally, this project includes click analytics to track user behavior and improve search results.

I initialized the index by importing video transcriptions from a popular YouTuber.

## Setup

To set up this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the command `npm install`.
3. Set up an Algolia account and create an index.
4. Replace the `APP_ID`, `API_KEY`, and `INDEX_NAME` in the `index.js` file with your own Algolia credentials.
5. Import your data to the Algolia index.
6. Run the project using the command `npm start`.

## Usage

To use this project, open the project in your browser and start typing in the search bar. The search results will appear in real-time based on your search query. You can also use the filters to refine your search results. Click analytics are enabled to track user behavior and improve search results.
